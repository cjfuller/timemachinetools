Time machine tools is a utility for copying data off an Apple time machine backup on a system (e.g. linux) that does not support the type of hard links used for the backup.
 
usage (with install through rubygems):
 
gem install time_machine_tools

tm_copy mountpoint sourcepath destpath

where:

mountpoint is the location to which the backup drive is mounted (e.g. /mnt/my_backup)

sourcepath is the source folder you want to copy, specified relative to mountpoint.  Its contents will be copied, but the folder itself will not.

destpath is the destination folder.  The contents of sourcepath will be copied (including subfolders, which will be copied recursively) into destpath.
