#  usage:
#       tm_copy mountpoint sourcepath destpath
#
#  where mountpoint is the location to which the backup drive is mounted (e.g. /mnt/my_backup)
#        sourcepath is the source folder you want to copy, specified relative to mountpoint.  Its contents
#                   will be copied, but the folder itself will not.
#        destpath is the destination folder.  The contents of sourcepath will be copied (including
#               subfolders, which will be copied recursively) into destpath.
